# Molecules ToGo

Share molecules fast — from QR to AR.

- Upload SDF/XYZ on desktop, generate a QR with embedded payload, scan on mobile, and view in AR — all client-side, no server storage.
- Next.js 15, TypeScript strict, three.js, <model-viewer>.

## UI updates

- Integrated dropzone into the 3D preview: click or drop directly on the viewer.
- QR link is generated automatically after upload; adjust rendering options and the QR updates live.
- Share & QR combined into one panel; "Tips" section removed; GitHub link in header.
- QR payload pages focus on viewing: AR has a single button, and Rendering Options are hidden behind an accordion by default.
